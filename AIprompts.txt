Firebase - Firestore Reactjs project
I have `users` collection which contains fields: displayName, email, role, branch
- role can be Franchisee or employee.
- users with `Franchisee` as role have `employees` subcollection


the `employees` is a subcollection for each user in `users` collection. 
the `employees` have documents (the document's id is the same as the UID of the user)

each document has a field called `userDetailsReference` Type: reference
The value for the field, is the same as the document id of the user being referenced to.
